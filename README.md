# FileManager

A custom-made console application to manage files with commands. A simplified clone of Windows terminal. It was developed for my .NET Bootcamp during my first year of university.

It was originally developed in my [DotnetBootcampYakovliev](https://github.com/xxamii/DotnetBootcampYakovliev) repository, but I copied it here for more convenient viewing.
